# ðŸ“Š Daily Progress Report - September 24, 2025

## âœ… **COMPLETED TODAY**

**HubSpot Fields Implementation - 100% Success**
We successfully created and tested ALL 7 required HubSpot fields for comprehensive tracking. Every field is now visible in your HubSpot interface and ready for automation. This includes 2 deal fields (trial_status, qualified_status) and 5 contact fields (vsl_watched, vwo_experiment_id, first_contact_within_30min, sales_script_version, vwo_variation).

**Complete PRD Coverage Achieved**
After analyzing your PRD requirements, we identified and created all missing fields needed for 100% metric coverage. Your dashboard can now track every single metric you requested - from trial rates to VSL effectiveness to A/B testing performance. No more manual tracking needed.

**Make Automation Guide Ready**
Created comprehensive English documentation for your Make automation setup. The guide includes 4 main scenarios with exact module configurations, connection settings, and testing procedures. Your team can follow this step-by-step to automate all field population from Kavkom calls, VWO experiments, and traffic sources.

**Testing & Validation Complete**
Created test contact (158039844455) and deal (44396763167) with all fields populated and confirmed visible in HubSpot UI. All API connections working perfectly with your current token. Everything is production-ready.

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT PHASE PLAN**

**Make Setup (Your Team)**
Your team will now configure the 4 Make scenarios using our English guide. This will automate qualified_status from call duration, trial_status from deal sources, vsl_watched from traffic, and vwo_experiment_id from UTM parameters. Once complete, all metrics will populate automatically.

**Dashboard Development (Next)**
After Make automation is working, we'll build the Next.js analytics dashboard with all 22+ metrics, breakdowns by user/source/time, and interactive visualizations. The dashboard will connect directly to your HubSpot data and provide real-time insights with compare modes and filters exactly as specified in your PRD.
